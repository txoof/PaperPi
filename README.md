## About PaperPi

PaperPi is a lovely, quiet, *slow internet* e-Paper radio. No loud colors, no busy animations, just a lovely selection of the information you want without buzz and distraction. PaperPi rotates through your choice of plugin screens at the pace you choose.

To get started, jump to the **[Setup Instructions](#setup_install)**.

### Why it's great

* Works with almost all of the [WaveShare](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper.htm) SPI displays out of the box with minimal setup or configuration
* Supports RGB screens
* Scales plugin output to match your display size from tiny 2" 1 bit displays all the way to 10" HD 8 bit displays
* Supports an open and hackable plugin architecture
* Easy install and configuration
* Quiet, low distraction display with just the content you want
* Looks great on your desk or in your living room

For information on building a frame, case and custom cable, see [these instructions](./documentation/Frame_Cable_Case.md).


## Plugins

PaperPi supports many different plugins and multiple layouts for each plugin that can provide different data.

## PaperPi Requirements

PaperPi is compatible with 32 bit Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye. Some python dependencies such as *numpy* may not build properly under Buster.

PaperPi will not automatically install under the 64 bit versions of Raspberry Pi OS. See the [Manual Installation Instructions](#manual-install-for-rpios-64-bit) for 64 bit installs below.

### Required Hardware

* Raspberry Pi (Pi 4, Pi 3, and Pi Zero)
* Raspberry Pi OS Buster or later (64-bit supported)
* [WaveShare EPD Screen](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper.htm) with PiHat
  * see the full list of currently [supported screens](#supportedScreens)
  * Note: HDMI screens are not supported

### Optional Hardware

* [HiFiBerry hat](https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/#boards) (*optional*)
  * The HiFiBerry DAC+ PRO and similar boards add high-quality audio output to the Pi so it can act as a display and also work as a LMS client player using squeezelite
  * GPIO 2x20 headers **must be added** to the HiFiBerry HAT to provide an interface for the WaveShare HAT.
  * HiFiBerry's [DAC+ Bundle](https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/bundles/hifiberry-dac-bundle-4/) with the following configuration is a good choice:
    * DAC+ Pro
    * Acrylic Case for (RCA) AND DIGI+
    * Raspberry Pi 4B 2GB (1GB should be sufficient as well)
    * 16GB SD Card
    * PowerSupply (USB C 5.1V/3A)
    * 2x20 Pin Male Header (required for WaveShare HAT)

### Optional Software

PaperPi plugins work with a variety of other software such as Logitech Media Server and Spotify. Check the [Plugin documentation](./documentation/Plugins.md) for further instructions

<a name="setup_install"> </a>

## Install & Setup

PaperPi requires only small amount of setup and is packaged with amateurs in mind. By default PaperPi will install as a daemon service that will start at boot.

Check here if you'd like a [step-by-step guide](./documentation/step_by_step_instructions.md).

### Install

To get started, copy and paste the following command into a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi to download the latest stable version of PaperPi and automatically start the install and setup process.

**Stable**

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txoof/PaperPi/main/install/remote_install.sh)"`


**Development**

`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txoof/PaperPi/I113_install_scripts/install/remote_install.sh | /bin/bash -s -- -b development`

**Self Install**

If you would rather install PaperPi yourself without running a remote script, [clone this repo](https://github.com/txoof/PaperPi.git) and run `./install/install.sh` from within the repo root.

**Other Branches**

If you would like to remote install from a different remote branch, use:

`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txoof/PaperPi/main/install/remote_install.sh | bash -s -- -b REPLACE_WITH_BRANCH_NAME`

### Manual Install for RPiOS 64 bit

PaperPi depends on pre-built wheels from PiWheels to create it's virtual environment. Installing PaperPi. Several critical modules (e.g. Pillow) will fail to install correctly and cause **shed-loads** of dependency errors. 

It is possible to manually install PaperPi on a 64 bit system, but it requires some extra work and is not officially supported. These instructions are intended for those that are savvy on the command line and can do some of their own problem solving. 

Thanks to @VaporwareII & @harperreed for helping sort this out.

This is all best done as root. Be careful and good luck: you're on your own!

1. Clone PaperPi into a temporary directory: 
```
git clone https://github.com/txoof/PaperPi.git
```
2. Run the install script and skip the OS Version Check: 
```
# ./install/install.sh -s
```
3. Change to the install directory and create a virtual environment: 
```
# export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1
# pipenv --python 3
```
4. Install `pillow` manually: `# pipenv install pillow`
  - this *should* avoid dependency issues
5. Install development modules 
```
# pipenv install --dev
```
6. Copy the entry script into `/usr/bin/`: 
```
# cp ./PaperPi/install/paperpi /usr/bin/
```
7. Enable SPI:
```
# sudo raspi-config nonint do_spi 0
```
8. Copy the configuration file to `/etc/default`
```
# cp ./PaperPi/install/paperpi.ini /etc/default/
```
9. Install and enable the daemon unit file (optional)
```
# cp ./PaperPi/install/paperpi-daemon.service /etc/systemd/system/
# /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
# /bin/systemctl enable /etc/systemd/system/paperpi-daemon.service
```
10. Edit the config file in `/etc/default`
11. Start the daemon (optional)
```
# systemctl restart paperpi-daemon.service
```

### Setup

**Daemon Mode**

The installer should prompt you to edit `/etc/default/paperpi.ini`. At minimum you must add your EPD Screen and enable several plugins. A complete list of supported EPD Screens are [listed below](#supportedScreens).

Any changes to the PaperPi configuration require a restart of the service:

`sudo systemctl restart paperpi-daemon.service`

To disable the service from starting on boot, run the command:

`sudo systemctl disable paperpi-daemon.service`

**On Demand**

If you would rather run PaperPi on-demand rather than a daemon service you can run it as regular user (e.g. pi) by running `/usr/local/bin/paperpi`. A new configuration file will be created in your user's directory. Make sure to edit this file and add, at minimum, your EPD Screen.

PaperPi can be run on demand in daemon mode using `paperpi -d`

### Configuration

The configuration file is kept in `/etc/default/paperpi.ini` for the daemon and `~/.config/com.txoof.paperpi/paperpi.ini` when run as a user. 

The configuration file is written as a `ini` style file. Each section is defined by square brackets `[Section Name]`. White space and comments are ignored. Variables are formatted one-per-line: `variable_name = value`. Strings should not be quoted.

The configuration file has sample values for each plugin that should work for most installations. Plugins such as the LMS and Spotify plugins require configuration.

**Configuration Structure**

`[main]`: The global configuration variables

* `display_type` (string): Name of [display](#supported-screens)
* `vcom` (float): negative floating point value printed on the ribbon cable of HD screens (e.g. -1.93)
* `max_refresh` (integer): maximum number of screen refreshes before a total (flashing) wipe (only applies to HD screens)
* `splash` (boolean): True to display the splash screen on boot; False to launch directly into the display loop
* `rotation` (integer): rotate the screen 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees. Most screens are oriented with the ribbon cable at the bottom.
* `mirror` (boolean): True to flip the content. This is useful if everything appears backwards on your screen

`[Plugin: Human Readable Plugin Name]`: Per-plugin configuration

Plugins configurations are always in square brackets and **must** start with the string `Plugin: `. Plugins that have leading characters are ignored and treated as disabled.

The same plugin can be configured multiple times in the same instance. For example, you may want to track multiple LMS players, or display weather for multiple locations.

Each plugin has the following required values and *may* have values specific to the configuration of the plugin. For example your location. Check the [Plugin Documentation](./documentation/Plugins.md) for more information.

* `plugin` (string): plugin_name - this is the exact name of the plugin and can be found on the plugin documentation page
* `layout` (string): name of layout to use. See the plugin page for an example of every supported layout for each plugin. Every plugin should have a default layout called `layout`.
* `refresh_rate` (integer): time in seconds before refreshing the data for this plugin. Some plugins connect to external APIs that discourage high rates of requests. A value of around 30-120 seconds is probably good for most plugins.
* `min_display_time`  (integer): time in seconds that represents the minimum amount of time the plugin should be displayed before cycling to another plugin. Setting this to a value lower than the screen-clear time for your screen is a mistake. 
* `max_priority` (integer): lower value plugins take priority over higher values. This should be left alone unless you're sure you know what you are doing.

Most plugins should have a maximum priority of 2. This is the default level for plugins that passively cycle. Some plugins such as the Spotify and LMS plugin set their priority to something like 3 when there is no relevant information to display. The value of 3 excludes them from the display loop. When music starts playing, the priority moves to a value of 0 to ensure that the rest of the plugins are displayed. Check the LMS plugin documentation for a full explanation.

### Uninstall

To uninstall PaperPi, run `./install/install.sh` with either `-u` to uninstall or `-p` to uninstall and remove all configuration files.

## Developing PaperPi

If you would like to develop for PaperPi or create [plugins](./documentation/Plugins.md) for PaperPi, you will likely need a working build environment. You can also hack on fonts and layouts directly on an existing install. 

### Development Requirements

* python 3.7+
* pipenv

**Create a Build Environment**

1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/txoof/PaperPi`
2. Run `$ ./utilities/create_devel_environment.sh` to create a build environment
    * This will check for all necessary libraries and python modules and create a local venv for development

## Contributing

PRs are always welcome! Plugins can be pure python, but should follow the [guide provided](./documentation/developing_plugins.md).

<a name="supportedScreens"> </a>

## Supported Screens

Virtually all WaveShare E-Paper screens are now supported!

* **WaveShare 7-Color displays are now fully supported**
* HD IT8951 Screens support partial refresh, fast update and 8 bit grayscale
* 2 and 3 Color screens (b/c variants) are only supported in Black/White mode

Most of the WaveShare screens that support 2/3 color output will also work with with the non-colored driver. Using the 1 bit driver can yield significantly better update speeds. For example: the `waveshare_epd.epd2in7b` screen takes around 15 seconds to update even when refreshing a 1 bit image, but can be run using the `waveshare_epd.epd2in7` module in 1-bit mode which takes less than 2 seconds to update.
