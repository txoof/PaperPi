##### PLUGINS #####
# Each plugin must be configured. A plugin can be
# included multiple times with different configurations
# e.g. to show the status of multiple Logitech Players, or
# weather in multiple locations or with different layouts

# find a list of available plugins:
# $ paperpi --list_plugins

# active plugins configurations must include:
# [Plugin: Your Name For This Plugin] # must start with "Plugin: "
# layout = name_of_layout # found in plugins/plugin_name/layout.py

# refresh_rate = seconds # number of seconds between updates to *data*
# min_display_time = seconds # minimum time plugin should show when active
# max_priority = int # values closer to 0 are high priority, negative values are ignored

# use `paperpi --plugin_info [plugin_name]` for a sample configuration and
# available layouts

# Fallback, default plugin to display if all else fails
