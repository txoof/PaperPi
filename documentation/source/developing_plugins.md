# Developing Plugins

PaperPi is designed to support additional plugins written in Python 3. Any modules available through PyPi or through a git repository may be used.

## How it works

When PaperPi starts, all plugins that are configured by the user  added as `update_function` to a generic `Plugin` class. This happens automatically and is managed for you.

The `Plugin` class offers several built-in functions and properties that plugins can take advantage of. See the "BUILTIN PROPERTIES" section below.

See the included [`demo_plugin`](../paperpi/plugins/demo_plugin) for a simple, well documented plugin that can be used as a template for building a plugin.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo `https://github.com/txoof/PaperPi.git`
2. Setup the development environment: `PaperPi/utilities/create_devel_environment.sh`
    - this will create a pipenv virtual environment with all the required components
3. Create a branch for your plugin: `git branch my_plugin; git checkout my_plugin`
4. Start developing! A good place to start is to make a copy of the `/paperpi/plugins/demo_plugin` for a relatively complete structure you can begin modifying.
5. Add any python modules your plugin requires using `pipenv install --dev ModuleName`
    - this will help keep your additional modules separate from the PaperPi core modules


### BUILTIN PROPERTIES AVAILABLE TO PLUGINS

All plugins have the following functions and properties available. Call the builtin functions by using `self.[method/property]`.

**Plugin Class Methods and Properties**

* resolution(`tuple` of `int`): resolution of the epd or similar screen: (Length, Width)
* name(`str`): human readable name of the function for logging and reference
* layout(`dict`): epdlib.Layout.layout dictionary that describes screen layout
* max_priority(`int`): maximum priority for this module values approaching 0 have highest priority, values < 0 are inactive
* refresh_rate(`int`): minimum time in seconds between requests for pulling an update
* min_display_time(`int`): minimum time in seconds plugin should be allowed to display in the loop
* config(`dict`): any kwargs in the plugin configuration from `paperpi.ini` that are not addressed here
  * Any values your plugin requires such as API keys, email addresses, URLs can be accessed from the `self.config` property
* cache(`CacheFiles` obj): object that can be used for downloading remote files and caching.

**CacheFiles Class Methods and Properties**
`cache_file(url, file_id, force=False)` download a remote file and return the local path to the file if a local file with the same name is found, download is skipped and path returned

Args:
* url(`str`): url to remote file
* file_id(`str`): name to use for local file
* force(`bool`): force a download ignoring local files with the same name

`cleanup()` recursively remove all cached files and cache path (this is typically only used when shutting down the application)

`cache_path: pathlib.PosixPath - top-level path to cache

### REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST

* [ ] Plugin modules are added to the `paperpi/plugins` directory
* [ ] Plugin modules must be named with exactly the same name as their module directory: `plugins/my_new_plugin/my_new_plugin.py`
* [ ] Include a `__init__.py` -- see below
* [ ] Plugin modules must contain at minimum one function called `update_function()`
* [ ] Include a file called `debian_packages-myplugin.txt` with any debian packages your plugin relies on (optional) -- see below for an example
* [ ] Include a file called `requirements-myplugin_hidden.txt` for any python dependencies that are not explicitly imported (optional) -- see below for an example
* [ ] Include a `constants.py` see below for specification
* [ ] Plugin modules must at minimum contain a `layout.py` file that contains a layout file. See the specifications below.
* [ ] At minimum the `update_function` should contain a docstring that completely documents the plugin's use and behavior
  * See the example below
  * End all user-facing docstrings with `%U`; to ensure they are included in the auto-documenting build scripts

**layout.py**
Within the `layout.py` file, the default layout should be named `layout`. It is acceptable to use a complex name and set:

    `layout = my_complex_name`
Layouts that require fonts should use paths in the following format: `'font': dir_path+'/../../fonts/<FONT NAME>/<FONT FILE>` Add additional publicly available fonts to the `fonts` directory (<https://fonts.google.com/> is a good source)

See the [epdlib Layout module](https://github.com/txoof/epdlib#layout-module) for more information on creating layouts

See the [`basic_clock` layout](../paperpi/plugins/basic_clock/layout.py) for a simple layout template

**\_\_init\_\_.py**

```from .my_new_plugin_name import update_function```

**constants.py**
The `constants.py` file must contain the following:
* `name = my_new_plugin` - plugin name that matches module directory name
* `version = 'version'` - version information
* sample configuration as docstring. This will be added to the .ini file on demand by the user to assist in configuration.

```
sample_config = '''
[Plugin: Human Readable Name for Plugin]
layout = layout
plugin = my_new_plugin
refresh_rate = 60
min_display_time = 60
max_priority = 2
additional_key = foo '''
```


**debian_packages-myplugin.txt**
If your plugin depends on any external debian packages they must be included in a `debian_packages-myplugin.txt` file where "myplugin" is the name of your plugin. Provide any additional debian packages as a bash array named `DEBPKG`. Bash arrays do not use commas to separate elements:

`DEBPKG=( "libfoo-dev" "formatter-FooBar" )`

**requirements-myplugin_hidden.txt**

If your plugin fails to install correctly due to hidden imports that are not correctly detected, they can be added using a flat file that lists one module per line. Use the name from PyPi.
```
cairocffi
cffi
CairoSVG
```

**OPTIONAL**

Plugin modules may have user-facing helper functions that can help the user setup or configure the plugin. User facing plugins should be documented using a docstring that contains the `%U` as the last character. See the `lms_client` plugin for an example that helps locate Logitech Media Servers on the local network. The `met_no` plugins for examples provides a function for finding the LAT/LON of a city or location. 

Example:
```
def say_hello(name):
    '''
    This fuction says "hello" to the user when called.
    %U'''
    print(f'hello {name}')
```

**update_function() specifications**

The update_function is added to a `library.Plugin()` object as a method. The update_function will have access to the `self` namespace of the Plugin object including the `max_priority` and `cache`. The `Plugin()` API is internally documented.

Checklist:
- [ ] `update_function` must accept `*args, **kwargs` even if they are not used
- [ ] `update_function` must return a tuple of: (is_updated(bool), data(dict), priority(int))
  * `is_updated` indicates if the module is up-to-date and functioning; return `False` if your module is not functioning properly or is not operating
  * `data` is a dictionary that contains key/value pairs of either strings or an image (path to an image or PIL image object).
  * `priority` indicates your modules priority
    * The default should be to return `self.max_priority`; it is allowed to return a negative number if your plugin detects an important event.
    * If the module is in a passive state (e.g. there is no interesting data to show) set `priority` to `2**15` to ensure it is not included in the display loop
- [ ] Returns a 3 tuple of `(is_updated(bool), data(dict), priority(int))`
- [ ] Required docstring:
    ```
    '''
    update function for my_plugin_name provides foo information
    
    This plugin provides...functionality
    
    # required configuration elements that must be passed to this plugin
    Requirements:
        self.config(dict): {
            key1: value1
            key2: value2
        }
        self.cache(CacheFiles object): location to store downloaded images
    
    # arguments the update_function accepts
    Args:
       self(namespace): namespace from plugin object
     
    # return values
    Returns:
        tuple: (is_updated(bool), data(dict), priority(int))
    # marker '%U' that indicates this is a user-facing function that should be included when producing 
    # documentation
    %U'''
    ```

**sample.py**

To provide a sample image and automatically create documentation provide a `sample.py` file. When documentation is automatically generated, a sample image will be produced using each available layout. 

```
config = {
    # this is required
    'layout': 'layout_name_to_use_for_sample_img',
    # optional below this point
    'config_option': 'value',
    'config_option2': 12345
}
```

## Adding Plugins to PaperPi

Once you've built an tested your plugin, you can add it to PaperPi by submitting a pull request. You should do the following to make sure your plugin is ready to go:

* Test your plugin and make sure it doesn't crash when an internet connection is unavailable, or a bad data is returned
* Run `$pipenv run python ./utilities/find_imports.sh` to update all of the python module dependencies for your plugin
* Run  `$ pipenv run python ./utilities/create_docs.py` script to make sure your README and sample images are built properly.
* Submit a PR that includes your plugin
